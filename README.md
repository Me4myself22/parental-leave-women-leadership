A quantitative social science project examining whether parental leave policy strength predicts women’s representation in corporate leadership.
# Parental Leave Policy and Women’s Leadership

## Project Overview
This project investigates whether the strength of parental leave policies is associated with women’s representation in corporate leadership roles. Using publicly available policy and labor market data, the analysis applies quantitative social science methods to examine how institutional support for caregiving may influence gender equity in leadership outcomes.

## Research Question
Does the strength of parental leave policy predict women’s representation in corporate leadership positions?

## Data Sources
Planned data sources include:
- Parental leave policy data from national and international policy databases (e.g., National Partnership for Women & Families, OECD)
- Women’s leadership and labor force statistics from publicly available government and research datasets

## Methods
The project will use exploratory data analysis and inferential statistical techniques, including regression analysis, to evaluate the relationship between parental leave policy strength and women’s leadership representation.

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Raw and processed datasets
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and analysis
- `src/`: Reusable scripts for data cleaning and scoring
- `reports/`: Figures and written outputs

## Status
Sprint 1 – Project proposal and setup
